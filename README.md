## Context

I'd like to build a Lumen application with a web application, but Lumen
no longer ships with support for interacting with session data.


## Goal

It looks like someone has already figured out the steps needed to work
with sessions in Lumen:

I'd like to try the changes out locally in a separate codebase before
applying them to the new application I'm building.
